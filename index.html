      <h2>BIO</h2>
      <p>
        Musician and researcher in Humanities, Arts, and Technology. He holds a
        PhD in Humanities from Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, Raúl Dávila’s
        research centres on the study of diagrammatic thought in sixteenth
        century mystic literature and its relationship with the aesthetic
        experience of contemporary culture and new media. He has two degrees in
        musical composition, one from the faculty of music of the National
        Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the other from School of Music
        of the National Centre for the Arts, both in Mexico City, as well as a
        Masters in Comparative Literature, Art and Thought from Pompeu Fabra
        University. Specialising in the field of Artificial Intelligence, with a
        particular focus on Natural Language Processing, his work considers the
        construction of language from the perspective of mystic science and
        computers. His own aesthetic proposal comes from the concept that he
        developed himself and has named <i>La Estética del Corte </i> (The
        Aesthetic of the Cut). Since 2018, he has been involved in the field of
        independent publishing as co-founder of the publishing platform Urbild
        Editions. His artistic work, both sound and visual, has been shown in
        different countries across America and Europe. Download full CV here

      <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>
        Doctoral Thesis: Technologies of Monastic Devotion and Prayer. The
        diagram of the <i>Mount of Perfection</i> by San Juan de la Cruz in the
        light of audible experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This research focuses on understanding the diagram of the Mount of
        Perfection drawn by the Spanish Carmelite monk San Juan de la Cruz.
        Starting from an analysis of methods of prayer from the ancient
        contemplative Carmelite order with roots in Palestine and from the
        theology of Eastern Christianity, the diagram is studied as a
        pedagogical method and as spiritual communication which employs social
        and mental prayer as principal tools for reaching a state of divine
        contemplation. The study examines the diagram from the theocentric and
        orbicular thought that antecede it, establishing links with the circular
        design of the graphical music symbols which appeared in the second half
        of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century with the
        emergence of animated scores. The purpose of this research is the
        creation of prototypes of animated scores taking as a point of reference
        the diagrammatic visual designs generated in a sacred and religious
        context. This idea invites a dialogue between spirituality, art, and
        technology.
